IMPORTANT: In order to run the script, you will need an extension such as tempermonkey. 
Once you have installed an extension that can run the script, you can now run it by pressing the built-in soundcloud shuffle button then playing a track :D
Please message me on Discord if there are any issues: @unicorndoll
